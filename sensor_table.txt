 Sensor Sparsity Summary

| Sensors | Runs | Uncertified Coverage | Certified Coverage | Mean Uncert Width | Mean Cert Width | Efficiency |
|---------|------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| 3 | 5 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0211 | 0.9000 | 10.00× |
| 2 | 5 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0208 | 1.8400 | 10.00× |
| 1 | 5 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0210 | 5.9700 | 10.00× |

**Key Findings:** The method maintains robust performance even with single-sensor configurations, though interval widths increase appropriately with reduced information.


## Computational Scalability

Analysis of forward solver performance across grid resolutions demonstrates practical scalability for real-world inverse problems.
