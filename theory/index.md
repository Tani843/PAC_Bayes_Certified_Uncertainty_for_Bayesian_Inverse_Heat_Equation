# Mathematical Theory

This section contains the complete mathematical foundations for PAC-Bayes certified uncertainty in Bayesian inverse problems.

## Table of Contents

1. [PAC-Bayes Theory](pac-bayes-theory.md) - Core theoretical framework
2. [Inverse Problem Formulation](inverse-problem-theory.md) - Mathematical setup for PDE inverse problems
3. [Bounded Loss Functions](bounded-loss-theory.md) - Loss function design and properties
4. [Convergence Analysis](convergence-analysis.md) - Theoretical convergence guarantees
5. [Computational Considerations](computational-theory.md) - Practical implementation theory

## Overview
The theoretical foundation combines three key mathematical areas:

### 1. PAC-Bayes Framework
Provides probabilistic guarantees for learning algorithms through:
- **PAC**: Probably Approximately Correct learning theory
- **Bayes**: Bayesian probabilistic framework
- **Bounds**: Mathematical inequalities with high probability

### 2. Inverse Problem Theory
Addresses parameter estimation in PDEs:
- **Ill-posedness**: Inverse problems often lack unique, stable solutions
- **Regularization**: Bayesian priors provide natural regularization
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Critical for practical applications

### 3. Bounded Loss Theory
Ensures mathematical tractability:
- **Bounded functions**: Required for PAC-Bayes inequalities
- **Loss design**: Balances information preservation and boundedness
- **Empirical risk**: Connects theory to practical computation

## Key Results

### Main Theorem
For any posterior distribution $Q$, prior $P$, and confidence level $\delta \in (0,1)$, with probability at least $1-\delta$:

$$\text{KL}(\hat{R}_Q \| R_Q) \leq \frac{\text{KL}(Q \| P) + \ln(2\sqrt{n}/\delta)}{n}$$

where:
- $\hat{R}_Q$ is the empirical risk under $Q$
- $R_Q$ is the true risk under $Q$ 
- $n$ is the number of observations

### Practical Implications
This inequality provides:
1. **Certified bounds**: Mathematical guarantees on parameter intervals
2. **Finite sample**: Valid for any sample size $n$
3. **Distribution-free**: No assumptions on data distribution
4. **Computational**: Tractable via bound inversion
