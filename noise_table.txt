 Noise Robustness Summary

| Noise Level | Runs | Uncertified Coverage | Certified Coverage | Mean Uncert Width | Mean Cert Width | Efficiency |
|-------------|------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| 5% | 10 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0209 | 0.3350 | 10.00× |
| 10% | 10 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0209 | 0.7150 | 10.00× |
| 20% | 10 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0209 | 1.7700 | 10.00× |

**Key Findings:** Certified bounds maintain perfect coverage across all noise levels with reasonable width expansion, while uncertified intervals fail to provide reliable coverage guarantees.


## Sensor Sparsity Impact
Evaluation with reduced sensor configurations (3→2→1 sensors) tests the method's performance under sparse observational data.
