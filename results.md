# Phase 7: Results & Graphs

![PASS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Validation-PASS-green)

## Overview

This page presents the complete results from Phase 6 validation experiments, visualized through publication-ready figures and comprehensive analysis tables. All results are derived from Phase 6 validation outputs without recomputation of expensive MCMC or forward model evaluations.

## Baseline Performance
The baseline comparison demonstrates the fundamental value of PAC-Bayes certified bounds compared to standard uncertified Bayesian credible intervals.

**Figure 1**: Posterior distribution showing uncertified 95% credible interval (blue) and certified PAC-Bayes interval (green) with true parameter κ=5.0 (orange dashed line). The certified bounds provide guaranteed coverage even when uncertified intervals fail.

### Baseline Metrics

| Metric | Uncertified | Certified |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Interval | [5.0018, 5.0225] | [4.8500, 5.2000] |
| Width | 0.0207 | 0.3500 |
| Covers Truth | ✗ | ✓ |
| ESS | - | 3000 |
| Reliability Tier | - | High |

**Key Findings**: The certified interval successfully covers the true parameter while the uncertified credible interval fails to provide coverage, demonstrating the critical need for certified uncertainty quantification in inverse PDE problems.

## Noise Robustness

Testing across multiple noise levels (5%, 10%, 20%) demonstrates the robustness of PAC-Bayes certified bounds under varying measurement uncertainty.

**Figure 2**: Coverage (left) and interval width (right) vs noise level. Certified bounds maintain target 95% coverage across all noise conditions while uncertified intervals show degraded performance.

### Noise Robustness Summary
| Noise Level | Runs | Uncertified Coverage | Certified Coverage | Mean Uncert Width | Mean Cert Width | Efficiency |
|-------------|------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| 5.0% | 10 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0209 | 0.3350 | 16.03× |
| 10.0% | 10 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0209 | 0.7150 | 34.21× |
| 20.0% | 10 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0209 | 1.7700 | 84.69× |

**Key Findings**: Certified bounds maintain perfect coverage across all noise levels with reasonable width expansion, while uncertified intervals fail to provide reliable coverage guarantees.

## Sensor Sparsity Impact
Evaluation with reduced sensor configurations (3→2→1 sensors) tests the method's performance under sparse observational data.

**Figure 3**: Performance with reduced sensors. Coverage (left) and interval width (right) vs number of sensors. Certified bounds maintain reliability even with minimal sensor data.

### Sensor Sparsity Summary

| Sensors | Runs | Uncertified Coverage | Certified Coverage | Mean Uncert Width | Mean Cert Width | Efficiency |
|---------|------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| 3 | 5 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0211 | 0.9000 | 42.65× |
| 2 | 5 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0208 | 1.8400 | 88.46× |
| 1 | 5 | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0210 | 5.9700 | 284.29× |

**Key Findings**: The method maintains robust performance even with single-sensor configurations, though interval widths increase appropriately with reduced information.

## Computational Scalability

Analysis of forward solver performance across grid resolutions demonstrates practical scalability for real-world inverse problems.

### Scalability Summary

| Grid Size (nx) | Runtime | RMSE vs Reference |
|----------------|---------|-------------------|
| 20 | 0.020s | 2.45e-03 |
| 50 | 0.089s | 1.12e-03 |
| 100 | 0.387s | 3.67e-04 |
| 200 | 2.680s | Reference |

**Key Findings**: The forward solver scales efficiently with grid resolution, enabling practical application to high-fidelity inverse problems with reasonable computational cost.

## Reliability Assessment

Statistical reliability of importance sampling across all validation experiments.

### Reliability Tier Distribution
| Reliability Tier | Count | Percentage |
|------------------|-------|------------|
| High | 46 | 100.0% |
| Total | 46 | 100.0% |

**Interpretation**: Reliability tiers based on Effective Sample Size (ESS) indicate the statistical quality of importance reweighting:
- **High**: ESS ≥ 1500, excellent statistical reliability
- **Medium**: ESS 800-1500, good reliability with minor uncertainty  
- **Low**: ESS 300-800, acceptable but increased uncertainty
- **Unreliable**: ESS < 300, results excluded from analysis

## Statistical Summary

### Overall Performance Metrics
- **Total Validation Runs**: 46 across all experimental conditions
- **Certified Coverage Rate**: 100% (46/46 successes)
- **Uncertified Coverage Rate**: 0% (0/46 successes)
