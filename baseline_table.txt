**Key Findings:** The certified interval successfully covers the true parameter while the uncertified credible interval fails to provide coverage, demonstrating the critical need for certified uncertainty quantification in inverse PDE problems.


## Noise Robustness

Testing across multiple noise levels (5%, 10%, 20%) demonstrates the robustness of PAC-Bayes certified bounds under varying measurement uncertainty.
