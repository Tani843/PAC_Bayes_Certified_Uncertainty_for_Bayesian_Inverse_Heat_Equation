# PAC_Bayes_Certified_Uncertainty_for_Bayesian_Inverse_Heat_Equation
Estimate thermal conductivity in the 1D heat equation from noisy, sparse temperature data using Bayesian inference. Goes beyond standard posteriors by applying PAC-Bayes bounds to deliver certified uncertainty guarantees, validated through noise, sensor, and scalability tests.
